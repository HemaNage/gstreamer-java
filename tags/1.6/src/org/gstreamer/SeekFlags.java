/**
 * Flags to be used with {@link Pipeline#seek seek} or 
 * {@link org.gstreamer.event.SeekEvent#SeekEvent SeekEvent}
 * <p>
 * All flags can be used together.
 *<p>
 * A non flushing seek might take some time to perform as the currently
 * playing data in the pipeline will not be cleared.
 *<p>
 * An accurate seek might be slower for formats that don't have any indexes
 * or timestamp markers in the stream. Specifying this flag might require a
 * complete scan of the file in those cases.
 *<p>
 * When performing a segment seek: after the playback of the segment completes,
 * no EOS will be emitted by the element that performed the seek, but a
 * {@link Bus.SEGMENT_DONE} message will be posted on the bus by the element.
 * When this message is posted, it is possible to send a new seek event to
 * continue playback. With this seek method it is possible to perform seamless
 * looping or simple linear editing.
