/**
 * Abstract class for global clocks.
 * <p>
 * GStreamer uses a global clock to synchronize the plugins in a pipeline.
 * Different clock implementations are possible by implementing this abstract
 * base class.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Clock} returns a monotonically increasing time with the method
 * gst_clock_get_time(). Its accuracy and base time depend on the specific
 * clock implementation but time is always expressed in nanoseconds. Since the
 * baseline of the clock is undefined, the clock time returned is not
 * meaningful in itself, what matters are the deltas between two clock times.
 * The time returned by a clock is called the absolute time.
 * <p>
 * The pipeline uses the clock to calculate the stream time. Usually all
 * renderers synchronize to the global clock using the buffer timestamps, the
 * newsegment events and the element's base time, see #GstPipeline.
 * <p>
 * A clock implementation can support periodic and single shot clock
 * notifications both synchronous and asynchronous.
 * <p>
 * One first needs to create a {@link ClockID} for the periodic or single shot
 * notification using {@link #newSingleShotID} or {@link #newPeriodicID}.
 * <p>
 * To perform a blocking wait for the specific time of the {@link ClockID} use the
 * gst_clock_id_wait(). To receive a callback when the specific time is reached
 * in the clock use gst_clock_id_wait_async(). Both these calls can be
 * interrupted with the gst_clock_id_unschedule() call. If the blocking wait is
 * unscheduled a return value of GST_CLOCK_UNSCHEDULED is returned.
 * <p>
 * Periodic callbacks scheduled async will be repeadedly called automatically
 * until it is unscheduled. To schedule a sync periodic callback,
 * gst_clock_id_wait() should be called repeadedly.
 * <p>
 * The async callbacks can happen from any thread, either provided by the core
 * or from a streaming thread. The application should be prepared for this.
 * <p>
 * A {@link ClockID} that has been unscheduled cannot be used again for any wait
 * operation, a new ClockID should be created.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to perform a blocking wait on the same ClockID from
 * multiple threads. However, registering the same ClockID for multiple
 * async notifications is not possible, the callback will only be called for
 * the thread registering the entry last.
 * <p>
 * These clock operations do not operate on the stream time, so the callbacks
 * will also occur when not in {@link State#PLAYING} state as if the clock just keeps on
 * running. Some clocks however do not progress when the element that provided
 * the clock is not {@link State#PLAYING}.
 * <p>
 * When a clock has the GST_CLOCK_FLAG_CAN_SET_MASTER flag set, it can be
 * slaved to another #GstClock with the gst_clock_set_master(). The clock will
 * then automatically be synchronized to this master clock by repeadedly
 * sampling the master clock and the slave clock and recalibrating the slave
 * clock with {@link #setCalibration}. This feature is mostly useful for
 * plugins that have an internal clock but must operate with another clock
 * selected by the {@link Pipeline}.  They can track the offset and rate difference
 * of their internal clock relative to the master clock by using the
 * gst_clock_get_calibration() function. 
 * <p>
 * The master/slave synchronisation can be tuned with the "timeout", "window-size"
 * and "window-threshold" properties. The "timeout" property defines the interval
 * to sample the master clock and run the calibration functions. 
 * "window-size" defines the number of samples to use when calibrating and
 * "window-threshold" defines the minimum number of samples before the 
 * calibration is performed.
