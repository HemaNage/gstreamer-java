     * If you have a stream with only one switch element, such as an audio-only stream, 
     * a stream switch should be performed by first emitting the block signal, and then 
     * emitting the switch signal with -1 for the stop and start time values.
     * 
     * The intention of the stop_time and start_time arguments is to allow multiple switch 
     * elements to switch and maintain stream synchronization. When switching a stream with 
     * multiple feeds, you will need as many switch elements as you have feeds. For example, 
     * a feed with audio and video will have one switch element between the audio feeds and 
     * one for video.
     * 
     * A switch over multiple switch elements should be performed as follows: First, emit the 
     * block signal, collecting the returned values. The maximum running time returned by block 
     * should then be used as the time at which to close the previous segment.
     * 
     * Then, query the running times of the new audio and video pads that you will switch to. 
     * Naturally, these pads are on separate switch elements. Take the minimum running 
     * time for those streams and use it for the time at which to open the new segment.
     * 
     * If pad is the same as the current active pad, the element will cancel any previous 
     * block without adjusting segments.
