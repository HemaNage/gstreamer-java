= Introduction =

Using gstreamer-java is simple, if not totally obvious, due to its dependency on JNA.

= Details =

Do use gstreamer-java, both gstreamer-java.jar and jna.jar need to be in the classpath.
e.g.  
To invoke the SwingVideoTest example program:
{{{
    java -cp jna-r433.jar:gstreamer-java-0.5.jar org.gstreamer.example.SwingVideoTest
}}}
Note: On windows, separate the jar files with a semi-colon ';' instead of a colon ':'.

Note: On Linux, you must use the Sun JVM - GCJ will not work.  Use java-version to determine which one you have.

gstreamer-java should automatically work on any platform JNA supports, but it is only regularly tested on MacOS, Linux and Windows.
