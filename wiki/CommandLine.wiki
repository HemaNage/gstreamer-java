= Introduction =

Using gstreamer-java is simple, if not totally obvious, due to its dependency on JNA.

= Details =

To use gstreamer-java, you need to download the latest versions of both gstreamer-java.jar and jna.jar and put them in the classpath.

e.g.

Download [http://gstreamer-java.googlecode.com/files/jna-3.0.4.jar jna-3.0.4.jar] and [http://gstreamer-java.googlecode.com/files/gstreamer-java-bin-1.0.jar gstreamer-java-bin-1.0.jar]. 

 * To invoke the SwingVideoTest example program on linux:
  {{{
    java -Djna.library.path=/usr/lib -cp jna-3.0.4.jar:gstreamer-java-bin-1.0.jar   org.gstreamer.example.SwingVideoTest
  }}}
 * Launching a command-line pipeline using the *gst-launch* syntax (currently only available from the latest subversion tree):
  {{{
    java -Djna.library.path=/usr/lib -cp jna-3.0.4.jar:gstreamer-java-bin-1.0.jar   org.gstreamer.example.PipelineLauncher videotestsrc ! autovideosink
  }}}

Note: On windows, separate the jar files with a semi-colon ';' instead of a colon ':', and you should not need to set the jna.library.path

Note: On Linux, you must use the Sun JVM - GCJ will not work.  Use java -version to determine which one you have.

gstreamer-java should automatically work on any platform JNA supports, but it is only regularly tested on MacOSX and Linux.
